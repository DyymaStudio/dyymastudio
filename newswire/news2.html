<p>In an unexpected announcement, we have decided to cancel <strong>Free Mode</strong>, which allowed players to roam freely outside the main school, will no longer be part of the game&rsquo;s future updates.</p>
<p>This decision was made to focus entirely on the game&rsquo;s lore and main horror gameplay. <strong>Free Mode</strong> no longer aligns with the direction we&rsquo;re taking, We want every part of the game to feel meaningful, intense, and directly tied to <strong>Angelica&rsquo;s Universe</strong>.</p>
<p>To make up for the cancellation, the long-anticipated <strong>V.1.3.0 update</strong> has been brought forward to <strong>April 11th, 2025</strong>. The update promises major story developments, new chaotic encounters, and key improvements that will shape the future of the game.</p>
<p>Players are encouraged to update their game on April 11th to dive into the <strong>First Bonus Level</strong> (which will be free to play) of Angelica&rsquo;s Chaotic Hardcore School.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for this decision, but we believe it was the most appropriate course of action for the future of the game.</p>
