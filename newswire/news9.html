<p>We are happy to announce that an <strong>experimental version</strong> of <strong>ACHSR</strong> will be released on <strong>Saturday, January 31, 2026</strong>. this update is a very important step for the game and represents a big change in its development.</p>
<p>The new version will change the gameplay in a strong and noticeable way, going far beyond a normal update. Because of this, we decided not to call it <strong>V.1.5</strong> anymore. instead, it will officially be <strong>V.2.0</strong>, to better show how big these changes really are.</p>
<p>The <strong>experimental version</strong> will be locked behind a <strong>password</strong>, which will be shared later. This will help us test the new features in a controlled way before moving on.</p>
<p>One last important note: starting from <strong>January 31</strong>, I will be leaving discord and will return in <strong>June 2026</strong>. During this time, all announcements and updates will be handled by <strong>Enri</strong> and <strong>Mr.Lurk</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your support. <strong>ACHSR</strong> is changing, and we&rsquo;re excited for you to see what comes next.</p>
