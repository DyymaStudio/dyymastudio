<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we would like to share an update about our work and our future plans. We originally planned to announce our new <strong>Dyyma&shy;Studio Games</strong> project today. However, the game is still in the early stages of development, and it is not ready to be presented to the public yet. We want the announcement to be clear, complete, and worthy of the project we are creating, so the reveal has been moved to next year.</p>
<p>We know that many of you have been waiting for news, and we truly appreciate your patience. We also understand that the wait feels long. <strong>Angelica&rsquo;s Chaotic Hardcore School</strong> has been a long-running project for us &mdash; it has lasted for a long time, and we dedicated most of our time and energy to it. Due to this, working on a new game naturally takes more time. Still, we are very excited about what we are creating, and we can&rsquo;t wait to show it to you when the right moment comes.</p>
<p>We also want to share an update on <strong>Angelica&rsquo;s Chaotic Hardcore School</strong>. <strong>V.1.5</strong> is planned to release in the first half of <strong>2026</strong>, and it will include improvements, new content, and the anticipated <strong>Gardening Level</strong>, which many of you have been asking for. Thank you all for your support, your interest, and your patience. your enthusiasm motivates us every day, and we are excited for the future of Dyyma&shy;Studio.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>DyymaStudio</p>
